# Flag clear

https://www.drupal.org/project/flag_clear

# Overview

This module provides functionality to remove user flags for nodes and other entities. Instead of requiring a user to login and remove the flag, the admin now has the ability to remove the flags as well. This functionality is often useful in user-submission use-cases, where users do not necessarily un-flag the content that are no longer valid (possibly for items or have been processed by administrators who handled flagged content).


# Installation

1. Put the module in 'sites/all/modules'
2. Enable the module on the 'admin/build/modules' page.

# Flag Manager
